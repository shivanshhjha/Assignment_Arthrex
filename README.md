This repository is for the Technical Assignment from Arthrex submitted by Shivansh Jha.
Here is the Problem Statement and I have attached the solution in C++ in the file AutoSuggest.cpp.


Problem 2

Implement an auto-suggest / type-ahead feature (as we see in case of Google Search) with a regex, “*”.
Input1: Upto 5 words with similar spellings
Input2: part of the words entered above in Input1
Output: List of words from Input1 containing the part / phrase entered in Input2

Example:
Input1: take, make, check, ack, rake
Input2: ke
Output: take, make, rake

Input1: take, make, check, ack, rake
Input2: *k
Output: check, ack
